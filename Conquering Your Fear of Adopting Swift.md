# Who am I?

Brennan Stehling
iOS Developer since 2008

I've built apps using Objective-C long before ARC, Blocks and GCD.

A lot has changed since 2008.

### The hero you do not expect but gets the job done

---

# What‚Äôs going on with Objective-C?

* Seasoned over multiple decades (NeXT)
* Proven APIs and Frameworks (lots of kits)
* Not going away anytime soon
* Legacy rooted in C 
* Complex builds (Header search path?)
* We can do better with Swift...

### LLVM is good. Swift is good.

# Why Swift?

Swift has many advantages over Objective-C

* Optionals are a superpower
* Languages features prevent errors and crashes
* Syntax is easier to read (no brackets or semicolons)
* Enhanced modularization

# Why Swift?
 
See Swift Thinking by Natasha the Robot
 
Lots of helpful information to get you started on the right foot.

# Why Swift?

Swift has many advantages over Objective-C

* Simplified tooling with Xcode (no header files)
* Frameworks are the primary building blocks
* Code boundaries which are now enforced (public, private, etc)

---

# Why Swift?

Swift has many advantages over Objective-C

* Dependencies can be organized more easily
* Swift Package Manager (coming soon)

---

# Why Swift?

What about CocoaPods? ü§î 

All those great pods may simply become Swift packages. 

---

# Business Reasons for Swift?

 * Hiring Objective-C engineers is getting harder
 * New projects are built with Swift more and more each day
 * College grads are unlikely to learn Objective-C
 * Swift will be less costly to maintain in coming years
 * Apps built with Swift make users happy

### How can we minimize costs?

---

# How can we minimize costs?

* Depend on Swift
* Don't depend on Objective-C

---

# How can we minimize costs?

* Depend on Swift
* Don't depend on Objective-C

### What does that even mean?!

---

# How can we minimize costs?

* Time updating legacy code is wasted time ‚è∞ = üíµ 
* Do not make your legacy code Swift compatible
* Just make your new Swift code compatible with Objective-C

---

# How can we minimize costs?

Creating new frameworks with Swift as new dependencies
can be made compatible with your legacy code base
from the start.

# What are the risks?

# What are the risks?

There are some risks, but at this point there's a lot
of content shared on how to avoid the common problems.

See recent SLUG talks. üöÄ

---

# What are the risks?

* Avoid structs
* Avoid tuples
* Avoid... 

See Michele Titolo's great talk which covers Swift gotchas.

# Finally, embrace the fresh start

* Approach your architecture with new ideas 
* Rebuild your most unreliable code with a new approach
* Let go of techical debt which is been building up for years

# More Resources

There are many ways you can use to get up to speed.
